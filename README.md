Dataset originally downloaded from :

## Below are some conlusive points after EDA step: 

- Glucose shows strongest correlation with diabetes
- BMI and Age show moderate positive relationship
- Dataset is moderately imbalanced as ~65% of records represent non-diabetic population while ~35% is diabetic, so this can bring some biasing while training the models.
- Older and obese individuals have higher diabetes prevalence
- Some medical variables required cleaning (zero replacement)
